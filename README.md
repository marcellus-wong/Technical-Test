INSTALLATION OF PYTHON AND MU:

I completed this task using Python and Mu, which is a software that allows me to enter my Python programs.

I've attached a link here, which explains the process of downloading and installing Python and Mu.

(This is quite an interesting book! Haven't had time to continue reading but I would recommend it!)





HOW MY CODE WORKS:

- It does require a user input so type in the input at the bottom window once you click run.
- The format in which you enter the input is crucial for this to work.
- Here is an example:

8 3
4 4 2
6 2 2
1 7 5


- Where values of N and M are entered first (N=8 and M=3), separated by a space.
- Since M=3, we need 3 extra lines of input to denote the X, Y and K values of each pizzeria.
- Once we have inputted our N and M, press the 'Enter' key to start a new line.
- Here we enter our values of X, Y and K, again separated by a space.
- To enter the variables for the next pizzera, we will click the 'Enter' key again to start a new line.
- We keep repeating this process until we have created a new line for each pizzera (3 new lines created since our M=3).
- Once we have finished with out input and want the process to run, click the 'Enter' key twice to output the result.





ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- I have attached 2 files of my code, one as a Python format that can be loaded directly from Mu. And the other as a text file, which can be copied and pasted into Mu.
- If there are any issues with any part of this, please email me and I will try to resolve (marcelluswong2@hotmail.com).
